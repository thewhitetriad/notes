An *expression* is a mathematical phrase that contains numbers, variables and operators.

Ex.  $\quad [3x + 9]$ $\quad [-7 + \frac{1}{2}]$  $\quad [1.3a^2 - 4ab]$

Expressions are made up of one or more *terms* (a number by itself or the product of a number and a variable).

##### Monomial
It's an expression that has only 1 term.
Ex.  $\quad 38m$

##### Binomial
It's an expression that has 2 terms.
Ex. $\quad -7y + \frac{1}{2}$

##### Trinomial
It's an expression that has 3 terms.
Ex. $\quad 8a^2 - \frac{3}{5}ab + 6b^2$

##### Polynomial
It's an expression consisting of variables and coefficients.

## Evaluating algebraic expressions

*Evaluation* is the process of simplifying an algebraic expression by first *substituting* a variable with a number and then computing the value of the expression using the order of operations.

Ex.  Evaluate $3x + 5$ when $x = 4$

$3x + 5$
$= 3(4) + 5$
$= 12 + 5$
= 17
